## üöóProject Overview:

**Why the title "Drive_Data_Analytics"?** This is a catchy name that blends the concept of "driving" (cars) with "data" and "Analytics", reflecting the predictive analysis features.

This project scrapes car listings from the Kai and Karo websites, stores the data in a database, and analyzes pricing trends in Kenya's car market. The objective is to automate the scraping process, store the data efficiently, and analyze pricing trends with predictive modeling to forecast future car prices.

## üß†Key Features:

* Scrape car listings data from **Kai and Karo** websites using Python.
* Store the data in a **MySQL** database.
* Automate the scraping process using **Apache Airflow**.
* Analyze the pricing trends of different car makes, models, and years.
* Create an **interactive dashboard** to visualize car price trends.
* Perform **predictive analysis** using machine learning to forecast future car prices.
