## Project Overview:

This project aims to scrape car data from the [Kai and Karo](https://www.kaiandkaro.com/vehicles?model__make__vehicle_type=Automobile)  website, store the data in a database, and analyze pricing trends in Kenya's car market. The dashboard will provide an interactive overview of key metrics, enabling users to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various factors influencing car prices.

## Tools:

* **Python:** For web scraping, data processing, and machine learning.
* **BeautifulSoup:** To scrape data from Kai and Karo websites.
* **MySQL:** For database management and storage.
* **Pandas:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Tableau:** For creating an interactive dashboard.

## Dataset

The dataset has 8 columns:
* Name - This is the name of the car
* Transimission_Type - Either Automatic or Manual
* Engine_Size - The size of the engine in cubic centimeters(CC)
* Usage_Origin - Either Kenyan used or Foreign used
* Year - The year of manufacture
* Price - The price of the car
* Make - The make of the car eg Toyota
* Model - Model of the car eg C200 for mercedes benz
* Car_Age - The age of the car
* Price_Range - Price categories

## Problem Statement

The Kenyan car market is characterized by fluctuating prices and a wide variety of options, making it challenging for buyers and sellers to understand current trends. There is a lack of accessible, comprehensive data that highlights pricing dynamics and vehicle availability. This project seeks to address this gap by scraping car data from the Kai and Karo website, enabling a deeper understanding of pricing trends and market behavior through a user-friendly dashboard that facilitates exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Data Processing

The data had 64 duplicates which were droped and all the data inconsistencies were corrected. Here is the [preprocessing file](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Drive_Data_Analytics/blob/master/preprocessing.ipynb) with the code used to clean the data.
